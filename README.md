# Deep Learning Andrew Ng
<font face='Cambria'>
This is all about Deep Learning Series provided by Andrew Ng at Netease Cloud Class. 

And I promise you that it's the completest version you can find on the Interent because I add some missing slides using screenshot at video.

Morever, I add some note directly on the slides, so that you did't need to click the video to recall something.

And in homework file, it's the code homework of the lessons, they are totally correct and had been run to make sure that.

I have a personal blog about this lesson and homework, most them are witten in Chinese, for your preference:

Hope this will be helpful for you.
