# Deep Learning Andrew Ng

This is all about Deep Learning Series provided by Andrew Ng at Netease Cloud Class.

I add some note directly on the slides, so that you did't need to click the video to recall something.

And in homework file, it's the code homework of the lessons, they are totally correct and had been run to make sure that.

I have a personal blog about this lesson and homework, most them are witten in Chinese, for your preference:
